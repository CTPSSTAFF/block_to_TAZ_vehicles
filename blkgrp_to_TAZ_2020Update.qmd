## Goal

We want a way to allocate census information into TAZs. TAZs are made up of census blocks, but sometimes split the blocks. We want to create a table that gives us a way to allocate census factors into TAZs.

### Set up Packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidycensus)
library(tigris)
library(mapview)
library(sf)
```

## Load shapes

```{r}
#| results: hide
 
#Load TAZ shapes
TAZ <- sf::read_sf("J:/Shared drives/Data_Requests/TAZ_Shapefiles/R_Script/out/geopackage/TAZ19.gpkg") %>% 
  st_transform(26986) %>% 
  filter(STATE == "MA") #%>% # Filtering to only in MA
TAZ$TAZ_area <- st_area(TAZ)
  #filter(ID == 4398) # Filtering for one example
# intersect them
# bring in building footprints
# find number of structures in each intersection
# also want to do share of land area--remove water?
# summarize
# output


# Load census block groups (other geography) tigris::block_groups()
cbtrue <- tigris::block_groups(state = "MA", cb = TRUE, year = 2020)%>% 
  st_transform(26986)
cbfalse <- tigris::block_groups(state = "MA", cb = FALSE, year = 2020) %>% 
  st_transform(26986)

#mapview(cbfalse) + mapview(TAZ, col.regions = "red") #+ mapview(cbtrue, col.regions = "yellow")

# cbfalse looks like it more closely follows the TAZ geometry


# massgis census: https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massgis-data-2020-us-census

#massgis rooftops: https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massgis-data-building-structures-2-d
# rooftops <- st_read("data/base/STRUCTURES_POLY.shp")
# 
# saveRDS(rooftops, "data/processed/rooftops.rds")






# problems that might come up. TAZ to census boundaries might be different (like microscopically different).

# find out which "block" shapes are used to create TAZs
# tiger/cartographic/state via massGIS.

# SPA give the TAZ geometry.
```

## Perform Intersections

### Intersections

```{r}
intersections <- st_intersection(TAZ, cbfalse)
intersections$intersect_area <- st_area(intersections)
# Trying it out with a subset
# ss_intersection <- intersections %>% 
#   filter(ID == 4398) %>% 
#   st_as_sf() 
# ss_intersection$area <- st_area(ss_intersection)
# ss_intersection$pct_intersect <- ss_intersection$area / max(ss_intersection$area)
# 
# ss_intersection_final <- ss_intersection %>% 
#   filter(as.vector(pct_intersect) > 0.01)
# 
# plot(st_geometry(ss_intersection_final))

# Only keeping intersection areas for a TAZ that is at least 1% of the TAZ area 
# (could also make it 1% of the largest intersection area)
intersections_clean <- intersections %>% 
  group_by(ID) %>% 
  mutate(pct_intersect = intersect_area / TAZ_area ) %>% 
  filter(as.vector(pct_intersect) > 0.01) %>% 
  ungroup()

```

### Look at Rooftop Share

```{r}
rooftops <- read_rds("data/processed/rooftops.rds")
plot(st_geometry(head(rooftops,1)))

#intersecting the rooftops with the census block groups
roofs_in_bg <- st_intersection(cbfalse, rooftops)

# finding the number of rooftops in each census block group
num_rooftops <- roofs_in_bg %>% 
  group_by(GEOID) %>% 
  mutate(num_roof = n()) %>%  
  distinct(GEOID, num_roof)
# Note: the number of census block groups goes from 5116 to 5110, meaning there are 6 block groups with no rooftops.  Also does not take into account if there are rooftops that intersect multiple blockgroups.  For some reason, there are less unique IDs in roofs_in_cb than there are in rooftops, but the sum in num_rooftops is the same as the number of entries in roofs_in_cb


saveRDS(roofs_in_bg, "data/processed/rooftops_in_bg.rds")
saveRDS(num_rooftops, "data/processed/num_rooftops.rds")
```

### Look at Area Share

```{r}

```

## Testing

### Test minority share

```{r}
minority <- read_csv("data/base/DECENNIALPL2020.P1-Data.csv")

```

Thoughts:

-   some TAZs are smaller than blockgroups, how would we account for the census data in that situation, or does it make a difference?![](images/image-1162217448.png)

-   There are 17,000 intersection areas, meaning that the boundaries probably don't add up. Brought it down to 8843 by taking out the smallest intersection areas

-   Anything with the rooftops takes a very long time
