## Goal

We want a way to allocate census information into TAZs. TAZs are made up of census blocks, but sometimes split the blocks. We want to create a table that gives us a way to allocate census factors into TAZs.

### Set up Packages

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(tidycensus)
library(tigris)
```

## Load shapes

```{r}
 #Load TAZ shapes
# Load census block groups (other geography) tigris::block_groups()
# intersect them
# bring in building footprints
# find number of structures in each intersection
# also want to do share of land area--remove water?
# summarize
# output

cbtrue <- tigris::tracts(state = "MA", cb = TRUE, year = 2020)
# cbfalse <- tigris::tracts(state = "MA", cb = FALSE, year = 2020)

mapview::mapview(cbtrue) 

ggplot(cbtrue |> sf::st_drop_geometry(), aes(x = ALAND, y = AWATER)) + 
         geom_jitter()
#+ mapview::mapview(cbfalse, col.regions = "red")

# massgis census: https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massgis-data-2020-us-census

# problems that might come up. TAZ to census boundaries might be different (like microscopically different).

# find out which "block" shapes are used to create TAZs
# tiger/cartographic/state via massGIS.

# SPA give the TAZ geometry.
```

## Perform Intersections

## Look at Rooftop Share

## Look at Area Share
