# block_to_TAZ_vehicles
Convert ACS block-level data on vehicle ownership to the TAZ level.

We are trying to develop a fresh set of factors we can use to scale census block data to TAZs. 

We want to do this for modern census data. The census blocks may have changed and thus we cannot simply apply the old factors.

We need to find *NEW* allocation percentages to go from a census block to a TAZ. 

Step 1:
Try to match the old process.
General steps: 
-Get block data and population from 2010 census.
-Multiply population by factor
-Add population by TAZ
-Compare against a known TAZ population.
-Verify that they match and find differences.

Step 2:
Develop a new process that can be repeated.
